            <p>Few of us escape childhood unscathed and Hyapatia is no exception.&nbsp; With the help of the medicine wheels, we can heal from our past.&nbsp; The tools on the Native Strength path will show us how to connect with our inner children and wise elders.&nbsp; Our inner elders can give us the love, acceptance, and understanding we deserve and have been missing.&nbsp; They can show us paths to happiness and success we may have not noticed before.</p>
